# Face-Recognition-with-Intel-D435i
Facial recognition with the Intel Realsense D435i Depth Camera. The main code for this project is a derivation of that found on the official Intel Realsense repositoy: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense

Begin by installing pyrealsense2 using the directions stated on the librealsense repository: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/python

I had librealsense installed for python 2.7.
Once installed, run the python script with the model files in the same directory. 
You now have a facial recognition solution using the Intel Realsense D435i (or any 400 series I believe) depth camera.
